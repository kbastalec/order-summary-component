## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to implement
[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
in my code in order to reuse color properties while styling the page.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - This list helped me find out/confirm various CSS properties. Navigation through it was easy enough and with the option to "Try it Yourself" I was able to visualize different options.
